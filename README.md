Online LFP and CSD Analysis and Visualization tool

This tool has first been developed in 2013 at College de France (Paris) in order to provide a real time analyzing and visualization tool for neuroscientists and electrophysiologists working on long and slow-paced experiments that can last up to 24 hours.
The goal is thus to benefit from the time spent in the experimentation room to already have the ability to process the data automatically and offer the researchers the possibility to start working on their latest data.
Having access to such data in real time allows also to instantly spot potential manipulation errors and to react accordingly.
